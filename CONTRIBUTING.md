## Pull Requests

A pull request should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. You will need `npm >= 6.14.12 ` and `node >= v14.16.1`.

**Ask before submitting a pull request** by creating an issue. The feature/refactored code etc. might not be aligned with current goals of the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhereing to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

    ```bash
    # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/maurya-editor-web.git
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd maurya-editor-web
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/MauryaEditor/maurya-editor-web.git
    ```

2. From the root directory of the forked repo, run `npm install`

Once all the node modules are installed, run `npm start` or `npm build` to validate that everything worked correctly.

3. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    ```

4. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

    ```bash
    git pull [--rebase] upstream main
    ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with a clear title and description.

## Cutting a release

1. Tag all merged pull requests that go into the release with the relevant milestone. Each merged PR should also be labeled with one of the labels name `tag: ...` to indicate what kind of change it is. Make sure all the breaking changes are correctly labelled with `tag: breaking change`.
2. Close the milestone and create a new one for the next release.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).
